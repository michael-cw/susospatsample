Description: A comprehensive Shiny application to process and sample from
    spatial resources. Spatial area frames can be created either through
    the creation of a regular grid, the use of gridded population data or
    from Enumeration areas boundaries. Besides sampling from an area frame
    (i.e. Enumeration Areas), the application also allows for sampling
    from geo-referenced points (i.e. Buildings). When the sampling is
    completed resources for data collection with the Survey Solutions CAPI
    system can be created, and directly assigned to the server.
