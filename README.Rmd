# Survey Solutions Spatial Sampling Application

<!-- badges: start -->
[![Lifecycle: experimental](https://img.shields.io/badge/lifecycle-experimental-orange.svg)](https://lifecycle.r-lib.org/articles/stages.html#experimental)

This repository contains the Survey Solutions Spatial Sampling Application[^1]. It's an essential tool for supporting survey sampling and implementation using Spatial Resources along with the [Survey Solutions Computer Assisted Survey System (CASS)](https://mysurvey.solutions/en/).

The Survey Solutions CASS leverages spatial resources in survey data collection operations. These can include boundary files (specific to an area) in the form of an ESRI shape file or background maps in the form of Tile map packages (.tpk) or geo-tif files (.tif).

For details on utilizing spatial resources in Survey Solutions, refer to the following links:

- [Shapefile Maps](https://docs.mysurvey.solutions/interviewer/special/shape-file-overlay/)
- [Map Formats](https://docs.mysurvey.solutions/headquarters/mapsmanage/map-formats/)

The application is built with R's Shiny framework to provide an *intuitive* Graphical User Interface (GUI). Visualization of the sampling frame and the sample is carried out using the [deck.gl framework](https://deck.gl) through the [mapdeck package](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/mapdeck/vignettes/mapdeck.html) or the well familiar [leaflet package](https://rstudio.github.io/leaflet/)[^2]. The sampling approaches currently incorporated have been applied in survey operations, and therefore the current (but also future features) incorporate a wealth of user feedback for which we are very greatful.

Furthermore the application is part of a larger set of tools to support the use of spatial resources in survey sampling and data collection. Other currently available applications are:

- [Grid Sample Replacement Application](https://github.com/michael-cw/susogrdframe)
- [Desktop Listing Application](https://github.com/michael-cw/susolisting)


## Main User Features

- **Sampling Frame Flexibility**: Supports both regular grid and irregular clusters.
- **Population Data Integration**: Easily include or combine population data in raster or points format.
- **Supported Sampling Strategies**:
    - Random or Probability Proportional to Size sampling at the area level, stratified or unstratified.
    - Spatially balanced sampling at the points level.
- **Survey Resource Creation**: 
    - Frame (csv format)
    - Sample with weights (csv format)
    - Shape file boundaries for Survey Solutions CAPI application
    - Base maps for Survey Solutions CAPI application
    - Sampling Report as Word document
- **Storage Modes**:
    - Local Storage
    - PostGIS-PostgreSQL (installation not included in the package)
- **Available Map Services**:
    - Single Layer Geo Tiff
    - ESRI tile package creation (Requires [ESRI tile server](https://developers.arcgis.com/documentation/mapping-apis-and-services/data-hosting/services/image-tile-service/))
    

#### Technical Features

- **Deployment**: Operates on local installation, [Shiny server](https://posit.co/products/open-source/shinyserver/) and [Posit Connect](https://posit.co/products/enterprise/connect/).
- **Modular Design**: Written in [Shiny modules](https://shiny.posit.co/r/articles/improve/modules/) for reusability, easy extension, and improved code readability.
- **High-Performance Capabilities**: Utilizes tools like:
    - [Data.table](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/data.table/vignettes/datatable-intro.html) 
    - [Fst](http://www.fstpackage.org/)
    - [Fasterize](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/fasterize/vignettes/using-fasterize.html)
    - Multi-core computation[^3] 

#### Admin Interface

- **Selection of Map Providers**: 
    - ESRI World Imagery (no key) 
    - Open Street Maps (no key) 
    - [Mapbox (with key)](https://www.mapbox.com/)
    - [ESRI map server (with key)]((https://developers.arcgis.com/documentation/mapping-apis-and-services/data-hosting/services/image-tile-service/))).
- **Selection of Storage Mode**: 
    - [PostGIS-PostgreSQL](https://postgis.net/) (requires server installation)
    - local storage.
- **Survey Solutions Integration**:
    - Connect to Survey Solutions API
    - Upload base maps and boundary files
    - Assign/un-assign maps to field teams.


## Installation

The package is not released on CRAN yet, so installation has to be done through installation from this repository.

#### Prerequisites

* [Install R, version 4.1.1 or greater](https://cran.r-project.org/mirrors.html)

* [Install R Studio, version 1.2.5001-3 or newer](https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/)

* Make sure the *devtools* package is installed, if not install it with:

```{r devtoolsinst,eval=FALSE, echo=TRUE}
install.packages("devtools")

```

* After that install the actual package:

```{r install,eval=FALSE, echo=TRUE}
devtools::install_github("michael-cw/susospatsample")

```

In case R prompts you to update/install any addtional packages, please confirm, ideally with update all. This may take a while, however these packages are required to run the application. **In case you are asked to install packages from source, please refuse, as this may take very long in particular in windows environments.**



## Running the application interactively

There are two options to run the application. The first one is in interactive mode. Start R Studio and run the following commands:


```{r start, eval=FALSE, echo=TRUE}
library(susospatsample)
## to use the leaflet map
susospatsample::runSpatSampleApp(mapwidget.option = "leaflet")

## OR to use the mapdeck map
susospatsample::runSpatSampleApp(mapwidget.option = "mapdeck")

```


## Running the application on a Shiny Server

The package also contains a shiny server function (open source or pro), which you can run, i.e. in an Ubuntu Virtual Machine on your PC. To run it on a shiny server, you need to create a server location (= directory), i.e. susospatsample and then put an **app.R** script inside of this directory. The script contains the following two lines:

```{r start_srv, eval=FALSE, echo=TRUE}
library(susospatsample)
## to use the leaflet map
susospatsample::runSpatSampleAppServer(mapwidget.option = "leaflet")

## OR to use the mapdeck map
susospatsample::runSpatSampleAppServer(mapwidget.option = "mapdeck")

```


That's all there is to do. Please make sure, you have read the [Spatial Sampling Application documentation](https://datanalytics.worldbank.org/SpatialSamplingManual/) before moving on.


#### Attention - Potential issue with ‘shinyalert’

There’s a known issue with the ‘shinyalert’ package from Dean Attali, which may cause the application to fail during start-up on certain Windows installations running the latest version of R. For more details, please check this issue.

This issue has been resolved in the development version of ‘shinyalert’, but the fix is not yet available in the official CRAN release. If you encounter this problem, please install the development version for ‘shinyalert’ using the following command:

```{r install_alert,eval=FALSE, echo=TRUE}
devtools::install_github("daattali/shinyalert")

```

## Feature requests and bug reports

You can either use the standard GitHub approach by filing a bug report/feature request [here](https://github.com/michael-cw/SurveySolutionsAPI/issues) or you use the Survey Solutions user forum [here](https://forum.mysurvey.solutions/c/api/13).

Please continue to check for updates, as we are constantly working to improve the application.

[^2]: Due to capacity limitations of the leaflet package some large data visualizations are only available when using mapdeck mode. Please be aware, that currently there may be an issue with mapdeck when using the lates R version on Windows systems, see [here](https://github.com/SymbolixAU/mapdeck/issues/359).
