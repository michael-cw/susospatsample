# Survey Solutions Spatial Sampling Application

<div align="justify">
This repository houses the Survey Solutions Spatial Sampling Application[^1]. It's an essential tool for supporting survey sampling and implementation using Spatial Resources along with Survey Solutions Computer Assisted Survey System (CASS).

Survey Solutions CASS leverages spatial resources in data collection operations. These can include boundary files (specific to an area) in the form of an ESRI shape file or background maps in the form of Tile map packages (.tpk) or geo-tif files (.tif).

For a comprehensive guide on utilizing spatial resources in Survey Solutions, refer to the following links:

- [Shapefile Maps](https://docs.mysurvey.solutions/interviewer/special/shape-file-overlay/)
- [Map Formats](https://docs.mysurvey.solutions/headquarters/mapsmanage/map-formats/)

The application's modules, built on R's shiny framework, provide a user interface. Visualization of the sample is carried out using the [deck.gl framework](https://deck.gl) through the mapdeck package.


## Installation

The package is not released on CRAN yet, so installation has to be done through installation from this repository.

#### Prerequisites

* [Install R, version 4.1.1 or greater](https://cran.r-project.org/mirrors.html)

* [Install R Studio, version 1.2.5001-3 or newer](https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/)

* Make sure the *devtools* package is installed, if not install it with:

```{r devtoolsinst,eval=FALSE, echo=TRUE}
install.packages("devtools")

```

* After that install the actual package:

```{r install,eval=FALSE, echo=TRUE}
devtools::install_github("michael-cw/susospatsample")

```

In case R prompts you to update/install any addtional packages, please confirm, ideally with update all. This may take a while, however these packages are required to run the application. **In case you are asked to install packages from source, please refuse, as this may take very long in particular in windows environments.**



## Running the application interactively

There are two options to run the application. The first one is in interactive mode. Start R Studio and run the following commands:


```{r start, eval=FALSE, echo=TRUE}
library(susospatsample)
## to use the leaflet map
susospatsample::runSpatSampleApp(mapwidget.option = "leaflet")

## OR to use the mapdeck map
susospatsample::runSpatSampleApp(mapwidget.option = "mapdeck")

```


## Running the application on a Shiny Server

The package also contains a shiny server function (open source or pro), which you can run, i.e. in an Ubuntu Virtual Machine on your PC. To run it on a shiny server, you need to create a server location (= directory), i.e. susospatsample and then put an **app.R** script inside of this directory. The script contains the following two lines:

```{r start_srv, eval=FALSE, echo=TRUE}
library(susospatsample)
## to use the leaflet map
susospatsample::runSpatSampleAppServer(mapwidget.option = "leaflet")

## OR to use the mapdeck map
susospatsample::runSpatSampleAppServer(mapwidget.option = "mapdeck")

```


That's all there is to do. Please make sure, you have read the [Spatial Sampling Application documentation](https://datanalytics.worldbank.org/SpatialSamplingManual/) before moving on.


#### Attention - Potential issue with ‘shinyalert’

There’s a known issue with the ‘shinyalert’ package from Dean Attali, which may cause the application to fail during start-up on certain Windows installations running the latest version of R. For more details, please check this issue.

This issue has been resolved in the development version of ‘shinyalert’, but the fix is not yet available in the official CRAN release. If you encounter this problem, please install the development version for ‘shinyalert’ using the following command:

```{r install_alert,eval=FALSE, echo=TRUE}
devtools::install_github("daattali/shinyalert")

```

## Feature requests and bug reports

You can either use the standard GitHub approach by filing a bug report/feature request [here](https://github.com/michael-cw/SurveySolutionsAPI/issues) or you use the Survey Solutions user forum [here](https://forum.mysurvey.solutions/c/api/13).

Please continue to check for updates, as we are constantly working to improve the application.
